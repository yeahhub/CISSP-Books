The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification is a globally recognized credential in the field of information security. Passing the CISSP exam requires a deep understanding of various domains in cybersecurity.

The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification covers a broad spectrum of topics relevant to information security.
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Security and Risk Management:</strong> This domain focuses on security governance, risk management, legal and regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations.</li>
 	<li><strong>Asset Security:</strong> It deals with resource protection, including physical and logical assets, data classification, and secure disposal.</li>
 	<li><strong>Security Architecture and Engineering:</strong> This domain covers security models, design principles, secure system components, and secure communication channels.</li>
 	<li><strong>Communication and Network Security:</strong> It addresses network protocols, secure network architecture, and communication security mechanisms.</li>
 	<li><strong>Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong> IAM encompasses user authentication, authorization, identity lifecycle management, and access control.</li>
 	<li><strong>Security Assessment and Testing:</strong> It involves security assessment techniques, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and security audits.</li>
 	<li><strong>Security Operations:</strong> This domain covers security monitoring, incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning.</li>
 	<li><strong>Software Development Security:</strong> It focuses on secure software development practices, secure coding, and software security testing.</li>
</ol>
Candidates must have a minimum of five years cumulative, full-time experience in two or more of these domains to qualify for the CISSP certification.

Earning a relevant post-secondary degree or an additional credential from the ISC2 approved list may also satisfy part of the experience requirement. The CISSP exam uses Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) for English exams and linear, fixed-form exams for other languages. The passing grade is 700 out of 1000 points, and the exam duration is three hours.
